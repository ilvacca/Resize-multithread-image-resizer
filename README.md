# Resize

Resize is a super-fast **multithreaded batch image resizing tool**. You can convert dozens of images in couple of minutes. This tool was developed by an astrophotographer for astrophotographer to make **timelapses** or **startrails** pre-processing phases faster and easier.
It **preserves EXIF informations** during conversion. TIFF, PNG and JPG currently supported.

## HOW IT WORKS

1. Choose the images you want to resize
2. Set:
	1. Output image quality
	2. Image resampling algorithm
	3. Length of the output image long size
	4. Output filename suffix (ex. "_CONVERTED")
3. Resize!
